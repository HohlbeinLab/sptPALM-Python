The folder contains pre-processed data namely localisations of single Cas12a
diffusing in bacteria and segmented brightfield images obtained from running
the macros "Macro_CellSegmentation.ijm" and "Macro_thunderSTORM.ijm" 
in ImageJ/Fiji on raw data files (not provided here)

Data and conditions taken from Olivi2024: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkae283

In total, we have two data sets representing
1) no DNA target sites being present (scrambled)
2) DNA target sites preset (targeting) 

Each set contains two data files with the localisations saved in a *csv
file (=> part1 and part2)
